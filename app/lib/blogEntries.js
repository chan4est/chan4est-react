It’s the city I spent over half my time in and I still didn’t have enough waking hours to do everything I wanted! It’s crazy how much there is to do within this city. I’ll cherish walking down the densely packed neon-lit streets, making wonderful memories with all my friends, being able to find a konbini at all times, and my Suica card 🐧\nI cannot wait to visit Tokyo many MANY more times in my lifetime!\nありがとうございます東京 🗼",

From Arashiyama Bamboo Forest to Kiyomizu-Dera, and Fushimi Inari Shrine…it was all so spectacular to be standing and exploring all the spots I’ve seen and heard so much about! \nWhile the visit was quick, I felt satisfied and kinda happy that I left some boxes unchecked. It gives me a great excuse to come back and do it all again!\nありがとうございます京都 ⛩️",

I had originally planned a lot more time here, but due to the Nurture Live tour being announced I had to cut things short. I still feel like there’s a lot more to explore when it comes to Colombia so I’ll definitely be back! \nThankfully, with the amount of time I did have, I was still able to catch up with one of my close friends @juan_____s! We both met in Rome, and then a little later during our Europe travels met again in Paris, and now months later in Bogota! Truly international friends! Maybe we’ll bump up the count to four countries later this year 😉\n¡Gracias Colombia! ¡Nos volveremos a ver muy pronto!\n📸 location credit: @ra1eigh, ty for finding the colorful buildings by scouring Google Maps + Flickr for me on a whim",

I think everyone there and myself felt incredibly lucky to be there as the weather was immaculate, and the crowds were thin.

    text: "I love Brazil, and Brazil loves me too! I've always wanted to visit Brazil but felt like I needed to get a little bit of traveling experience under my belt before taking the plunge. Having some friends from Brazil would’ve made me feel a lot comfortable as well, and thankfully while in Europe I found @martinezpedro__ and @samantakazahaya \nI met Pedro  in a bar in Budapest while we were both traveling through Europe. We were both very similar. Both worked in tech, both doing our first serious traveling, both liked to party (in moderation), and more! At some point in the conversation, he said very genuinely that I should come to Rio de Janeiro for Carnival in February! All while telling me all about how much fun he, his friends, and the entire country have while celebrating the holiday! Without any hesitation, I agreed to go, and when I got back to from Europe, it was the next trip I started planning! \nFast forward a few months, and there I was! In Brazil, at Pedro’s, enjoying life like a Carioca. Looking back, I guess it was a little insane. Staying in the home of a friend that I had met ONCE all the way across the world, in Rio of all places, just off of one single conversation. I honestly had very little doubts in my mind about the absurdity of it all, and thankfully the leap of faith paid off, and I had the time of my life! The first few days were chill, and felt like a great vacation. Seeing the touristy sites of Rio, trying out all the delicious and unique Brazilian food, and learning how to manage getting around the city without running into issues. Then after a few days the festivities began! All of Pedro’s lifelong friends (brothers in my eyes) came to Rio to stay with us and then the real fun began. All of us, going from bloco to bloco, day after day for 5 days days straight! Insane!! The closest way to describe it would be like if you went to a music festival, but the festival is scattered all throughout a gigantic and beautiful city, and EVERYONE is huge HUGE fan of every artist on the lineup! Everyone is singing along! Everyone is dancing! Everyone is in included! Everyone is having the best day of their life! I loved Carnival sooo so much and while a lot of that love comes from Carnival itself, I feel like a lot of that love was thanks to all the friends who made me feel so included and loved during the entirety of it.\nI couldn’t party forever though…so after Rio I did a small trip to Iguaçu falls to experience one of the natural wonders of Brazil (more on that later), then São Paulo to experience a more metropolitan version of a Brazil, and finally ending up in Caraguatatuba at Samanta’s to experience the laid back beachy vibes of Brazil. Samanta and I met in our hostel in Rome, and by then I had already had my sights set on visiting Brazil. She was happy to host me once I told her about my travel plans, so we made it happen! Getting to experience the more relaxing, quiet, and more local vibe was exactly what I needed after the nearly nonstop action of Rio. \nI cannot wait to visit again! Brazil is a HUGE country, like the same square mileage as the continental US! Definitely wouldn’t mind checking out more of the national parks, eating more Brazilian food, and of course more spending time with my new friends. Maybe I’ll know a bit more Portuguese by then! Until then, valeu valeu obrigado!",

It felt like I was already in San Francisco just instead of the Pacific Ocean, it was the Atlantic.

When I saw the train seat prices I did some comparisons on flight tickets and quickly decided against it. It gave me the perfect excuse to go visit Spain! With the limited time I could only realistically visit one city so the question was Barcelona or Madrid? Madrid won solely because of Museo del Prado!\nI feel like I made the right decision as Madrid was stellar! It all felt reminiscent of California and ultimately made me feel a little homesick. I also felt a lot of the the Spanish I used to know come back almost naturally as I explored! My stop here was fairly quick, but I know I’ll be back someday as I really want to complete the Camino Frances. Something to look forward to!",

Paris fell into the same legendary status for me like Italy did, and luckily it also delivered on all fronts.\nThe city as a whole was wayyy larger than I expected. I’m so glad I reserved extra time in Paris as there was just so much stuff to do! Everything I did while I was in Paris felt so fulfilling. Like I’ve been waiting my entire life just to experience every moment. Having authentic French pastries and fancy French cuisine. Exploring The Louvre and Orsay Museums. Being up close to the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, and Arc de Triomphe. All just magnificent!\nI was warned that French are a little rude towards foreigners who don’t speak the language so I did feel a bit intimidated going in. I oddly felt the most out of place during my first day in Paris. This feeling went away once I started noticing the smiles on people’s faces when I was trying to use the small amount of French I did know. After that, I felt welcomed and much more confident for the rest of my stay. I cannot wait to come back!",

I’ve been wanting to visit ever since I was very young when my Dad taught me and my sister about the wonders of Ancient Rome, the impact of the Renaissance, and the importance of travel. Italy was always THE country I imagined going to when visiting Europe so it was surreal to finally be there. Hearing all the hype from other travelers I met this month made me even more excited to go and experience it all for myself!\nTo say that Italy lived up to my expectations is an understatement. The ancient architecture was so epic that I was filled with excitement whenever it was in eyesight. The art was so beautiful it brought me to tears multiple times. The food was…the food was the best I’ve ever had in my life! I am stunned by how much everything lived up to the hype, and was sad that I eventually had to leave.\nI eagerly want to head back already. I feel like I only scratched the surface and could easily spend several more weeks exploring. I want to experience everything Italy has to offer! Until that time comes, I will cherish the time I had here immensely. Grazie Italia!",
