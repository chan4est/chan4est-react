        The legendary and iconic Egypt! It was an absolute treat to finally
        experience the wonders of ancient Egypt and more! Egypt was another one
        of the countries my dad visited during his youth and always praised so
        much while my sister and I were growing up. There was a magnet of the
        pyramids on our fridge which after looking at it almost every day during
        my childhood, subtly pushed me to go and see them for myself. Now,
        I&apos;m finally here!

        Egypt was the first country where I hired a private guide! I wanted to
        treat myself to absorbing as much history as I possibly could and
        I&apos;m happy I did so with Egyptologist @guide. He made site-seeing
        engaging, intriguing, and effortless. I learned more than I
        would&apos;ve ever done solo or with a group. It was the deluxe Egypt
        experience! I did make sure to have an extra day at the pyramids just to
        roam around by myself though. It was funny having all the hustlers
        trying to sell me a camel ride only to see them turn around disappointed
        once I showed them my photo. All part of the fun ðŸ˜‰

        While I was a tourist in the morning, I was a local by night. My friend
        Abdula and I were lucky to get acquainted through our mutual friend
        Centili and I feel extremely lucky that our fates intertwined. He knew
        the best spots for hanging out, kicking back, and experiencing life like
        a modern Egyptian. I felt so much love and gratitude wherever we went
        due to his outgoing personality and extreme passion for making his
        guests feel at home. I luckily felt that during my time in Egypt, and I
        urge everyone to come to Egypt to experience the same.
